# Music-Genre-Clasification-Mathematica
In the project we will be analyzing an audio signal and extracting properties which will be used to determine genre of that signal. Then it will be classified into different genres.  

I have used the GTZAN dataset for the training of the model of 1000 snippets. The dataset used here is GTZAN Dataset, of which,  10 genres have been used in this project. Each genre contains 100 music files, which belong to a particular genre, and each file's length is of 30 seconds. 

The features which were extracted from the raw audio signal are Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Roll-off, Spectral Centroid, Loudness, Spectral Contrast, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
